# Custom Bulma

The objective is create a repo to customize bulma based on projects. To achieve that, I'll be creating branches with the name of the project and set up all the files to build the final bulma CSS with the custom stuff.

## Current Projects

[branch] - [project]

- **master** - *Starting Point*
- **repos-admin** - *Github Repos Administration*
